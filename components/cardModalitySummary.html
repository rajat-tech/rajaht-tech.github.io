    Normalized internal density uses Mark Newman's formula of modularity for the internal edges of the subgraph defined by this modality ({{modality.value}}). Though density only depends on the subgraph, normalized density situates it in the context of the whole graph. It can be interpreted as the contribution of each pair of modality groups to modularity.

    Formula for normalized density:
    <br><br>
    <em>D = 1/(4*m) + Sum[Aij - ki*kj/(2*m)]</em>
    <br><br>
    Where <em>i</em> is a node from group 1 and <em>j</em> from group 2, <em>m</em> is the size of the network (edges count), <em>Aij = 1</em> if there is an edge from <em>i</em> to <em>j</em> and 0 else, <em>ki</em> is the outdegree of <em>i</em> and <em>kj</em> the indegree of <em>j</em>.
    <br><br>
