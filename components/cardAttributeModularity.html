  Modularity is the fraction of the edges that fall within the modality groups minus the expected fraction if edges were distributed at random.
  <br><br>
  The value of the modularity lies in the range [âˆ’0.5,&nbsp;1]. It is positive if the number of edges within groups exceeds the number expected on the basis of chance. For a given division of the network's vertices into some modules, modularity reflects the concentration of edges within modules compared with random distribution of links between all nodes regardless of modules.
